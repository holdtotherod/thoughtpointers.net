date: 31/01/2013

Frustrated by Pixelmator.app appearing in Finder's Open With menu five times? Does your Open With menu look anything like this?

Time to rebuild the launch services database:

For OS X >= 10.5

	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user

For OS X 10.3 - 10.4

	/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/\Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister \-kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
