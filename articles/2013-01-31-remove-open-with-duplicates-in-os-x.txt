title: Remove 'Open With' Duplicates in OS X
date: 31/01/2013

Frustrated by Pixelmator.app appearing in your Open With Menu five times? Does your Open With Menu look anything like this?

![Open With Duplicates](http://f.cl.ly/items/3S1K0U0x1t183s1Z0D2C/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-31%20at%209.39.32%20AM.png)

Time to rebuild the launch services database:

For OS X >= 10.5

	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user

For OS X 10.3 - 10.4

	/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/\Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister \-kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user
