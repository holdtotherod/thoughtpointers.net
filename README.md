===================

My blog to keep track of things I do with technology, stuff I learn, and projects I'm excited to share.

## Engine

The amazing minimalist bloggin engine [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto).

## Template

Started with dorothy, a starter template for toto. This then expanded to a template provided by [styleshout](http://www.styleshout.com/), which has been customized to meet my needs.

## Usage

Feel free to use my blog design with proper attribution to the original template authors. If you do use my blog as a starting point, just remove the content (anything in articles, etc) before you go live.

I just ask that the content be used under a Creative Commons license: [Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
